    <h1>A Tribute To Martin Ødegaard</h1>
    <div id="tribute-info">
      <p>Arriving as a teenager to the Royalty of Europe, Real Madrid, Martin grew through the ranks, going from Castilla to Vitesse in the Edervise, becoming one of the only non Ajax players to break in the Edervise Team Of The Year, then moving on to Real Sociedad, becoming one of the best players of La Liga.</p>
      <p>Martin was marred by injuries and the revival of the duo of veterans Kroos and Modric, eventually unable to break into the squad, and being loaned on to Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Onwards to Arsenal, his presence has affected the team into being one of the most dominant sides in Europe, ultimately keeping them toe to toe in the Premier League with Manchester City, only losing to squad depth.</p>
      <p>One can surely not deny excitement at Martin's captaincy in Thursday nights in the Champions League.</p>
