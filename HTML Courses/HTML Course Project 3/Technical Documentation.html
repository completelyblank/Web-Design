          <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
          <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.</p>
          <ul>
  <li>C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>
  <code>
    int main() 
    {
      printf("Hello World!");
      return 0;
    } 
  </code>
</pre>
        <section class="main-section" id="ruby">
          <header>Ruby</header>
          <p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. </p>
          <p>Ruby has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl, Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language. Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.</p>
          <ul>
  <li>Ruby can easily be connected to DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>
  <code>
    def test(a1 = "Ruby", a2 = "Perl")
   puts "The programming language is #{a1}"
   puts "The programming language is #{a2}"
end
test "C", "C++"
test

        <section class="main-section" id="c++">
          <header>C++</header>
          <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
          <p> C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.</p>
          <ul>
  <li>C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>
  <code>
    void myFunction() 
    {
      cout << "I just got executed!";
    }

    int main() 
    {
      myFunction(); // call the function
      return 0;
    }

        <section class="main-section" id="python">
          <header>Python</header>
          <p>Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. It’s a great first language because Python code is concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, python can do it. </p>
          <p>Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then Python could be your great choice.</p>
          <ul>
  <li>Python has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>
  <code>
   def my_function(fname, lname):
      print(fname + " " + lname)

        <section class="main-section" id="javascript">
          <header>Javascript</header>
           <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
          <p>You interact with JavaScript code all the time — you just might not realize it. It powers dynamic behavior on websites and plays an important role in many fields, like front- and back-end engineering, game and mobile development, virtual reality, and more.</p>
          <ul>
  <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
          </ul>
